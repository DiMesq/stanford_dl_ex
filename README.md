Programming exercises for the Stanford Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial

This repository contains the code for the tutorial at http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial

The starter code is given in MATLAB, but I will attempt to make the exercises using Python together with some of it's libraries.
